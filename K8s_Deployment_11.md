# Kubernetes Deployment

## 1. What is a Deployment?

* Deployments are the backbone of Kubernetes applications.
* They manage the lifecycle of Pods and provide features like scaling, rolling updates, and rollback.

üëâ When you define and use a Deployment:
* The Deployment automatically creates a ReplicaSet in the background.

---

## ReplicaSet Management

* The ReplicaSet ensures that the desired number of Pods are running at all times.
* The ReplicaSet creates and manages Pods.
* Inside each Pod, there can be one or more containers running your application.

üìå **Flow:** Deployment ‚Üí ReplicaSets (RS) ‚Üí Pods ‚Üí Containers

---

## Self-Healing in Deployments

* Kubernetes automatically replaces failed or unhealthy Pods to maintain the desired state.
* The controller manager constantly watches the Pods and recreates them if they fail.

üëâ Once the Deployment is set up:
* The only manual task is updating configuration (e.g., changing image version).

After that, Kubernetes handles:
* Rolling updates (gradually replacing old Pods with new ones).
* Rollbacks (if an update causes issues, Kubernetes rolls back to the previous stable version).

---

## 2. Key Features of Deployments

* **Replica Management** ‚Äì Ensures the specified number of Pods are always running.  
* **Rolling Updates** ‚Äì Updates applications gradually with minimal or no downtime.  
* **Rollback Capability** ‚Äì Easily revert to a previous version if a rollout fails.  
* **Declarative Scaling** ‚Äì Adjust the number of replicas by changing a single field in the YAML file.

## 3. Deployment Strategies in Kubernetes

When you release a new version of your application, Kubernetes offers different strategies to control how Pods are updated.  

The two main strategies are:

1. **Recreate**  
2. **RollingUpdate**

---

## 1. Recreate Strategy

* In this strategy, all the old Pods are terminated first, and then new Pods are created with the updated version.
* This means there will be downtime during the update because, for a short period, no Pods are available to serve requests.

### When to use Recreate?

* When downtime is acceptable.  
* When running two versions of the app at the same time could cause conflicts (e.g., database schema changes).  

### Example Flow

```

Step:1 Existing Pods ‚Üí \[v1]\[v1]\[v1]
Step:2 Delete all Pods
Step:3 Start new Pods ‚Üí \[v2]\[v2]\[v2]

````

‚ö†Ô∏è **Notice:** There‚Äôs a gap between step 2 and step 3 ‚Üí downtime.

---

### YAML Example (Recreate Strategy)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: javawebapp-deployment
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: javawebapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: javawebapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: javawebapp-container
        image: satyamolleti4599/maven-web-app:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: javawebapp-service
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  selector:
    app: javawebapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080        # Service port
      targetPort: 8080  # Container port
      nodePort: 30008   # Must be between 30000‚Äì32767 if type=NodePort
  type: NodePort

````

---

### Step 1: Apply Deployment

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl get all -n test-ns
```

* Creates Deployment, ReplicaSet, Pods, Service.
* Shows all resources (Pods with image 1.0.0).

Pods running:

```
pod/javawebappdeploy-59466fe944-2xskd
pod/javawebappdeploy-59466fe944-dnrcp
pod/javawebappdeploy-59466fe944-c6f8f
```

Deployment details:

* READY: 3/3
* UP-TO-DATE: 3
* AVAILABLE: 3

ReplicaSet details:

* DESIRED = 3
* CURRENT = 3
* READY = 3

üìå **Deployment ‚Üí ReplicaSet ‚Üí Pods**

---

### Checking Rollout Status

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment javawebappdep -n test-ns
```

Output:

```
deployment "javawebappdep" successfully rolled out
```

---

### Step 2: Update to Version 1.0.1

* Update image in YAML:

  ```yaml
  image: satyamolleti4599/maven-web-app:1.0.1
  ```

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl get all -n test-ns
```

Because strategy is **RollingUpdate**:

* Old Pods are deleted in batches.
* New Pods are created gradually ‚Üí ‚úÖ No downtime.

---

## Step 3: Checking Deployment Rollout History

* Each update creates a new ReplicaSet and a new revision number.
* You can confirm which image was deployed and what configuration was applied.

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment javawebappdep -n test-ns --revision=2
```

---

### Step 4: Update Deployment to Version 1.0.2

Change YAML:

```yaml
image: satyamolleti4599/maven-web-app:1.0.2
```

Apply update:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl get all -n test-ns
```

---

### Step 5: Update to Version 2.0.0

Change YAML:

```yaml
image: satyamolleti4599/maven-web-app:2.0.0
```

Apply and check rollout:

```bash
kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
kubectl rollout status deployment javawebappdeploy -n test-ns
```

Rollout process shows:

* 0 of 3 available ‚Üí downtime
* 1/3, 2/3 available ‚Üí partial availability
* 3/3 available ‚Üí rollout completed

---

### Step 6: Kubernetes Deployment Rollout History and Rollback

1. **Check rollout history**

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout history deployment javawebappdeploy -n test-ns
   ```

2. **Verify state**

   ```bash
   kubectl get all -n test-ns
   ```

3. **Perform rollback**

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment javawebappdeploy -n test-ns --to-revision=3
   ```

üëâ Kubernetes scales down the current RS and scales up the older RS.

4. **After rollback**
   Check again ‚Üí old ReplicaSet becomes active.

5. **Revision numbers keep increasing**
   Even rollbacks get a new revision number.
   Rollback to revision 3 ‚Üí logged as revision 5.

6. **Rolling back to Revision 1**

   ```bash
   kubectl rollout undo deployment javawebappdeploy -n test-ns --to-revision=1
   ```

---

## 2. RollingUpdate Strategy (Default in Kubernetes)

### Overview

* Pods are updated gradually, one by one (or in small batches).
* Some old Pods keep running while new Pods are created.
* Ensures minimal or zero downtime.

When to use:

* Application must be **available 24/7**
* Safe for old and new versions to run together

### Example Flow

```
Step 1: [v1][v1][v1]
Step 2: [v2][v1][v1]
Step 3: [v2][v2][v1]
Step 4: [v2][v2][v2]
```

---

### YAML Example (RollingUpdate Strategy)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: javawebapp-deployment
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  replicas: 3
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: javawebapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: javawebapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: javawebapp-container
        image: satyamolleti4599/maven-web-app:1.0.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: javawebapp-service
  namespace: test-ns
spec:
  selector:
    app: javawebapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080        # Service port
      targetPort: 8080  # Container port
      nodePort: 30008   # Must be between 30000‚Äì32767 if type=NodePort
  type: NodePort

```

---

### RollingUpdate Process

1. Apply Deployment:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
   ```

2. Check Pods:

   ```bash
   kubectl get po -n test-ns
   ```

   * New Pods ‚Üí `ContainerCreating`
   * Old Pods ‚Üí `Terminating`
   * New Pods eventually reach `Running` state.

3. Final State:

   * Old ReplicaSet ‚Üí scaled down to 0.
   * New ReplicaSet ‚Üí scaled up to desired count.

---

### Why RollingUpdate is Preferred?

**No downtime** ‚Äì At least one Pod always running.
**Safer upgrades** ‚Äì Stops rollout if new Pods fail.
**Easy rollback** ‚Äì Switch back to older ReplicaSet.
**Production standard** ‚Äì Default strategy for high availability clusters.
